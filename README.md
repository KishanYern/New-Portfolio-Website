# New-Portfolio-Website

Created a revamped portfolio website using ReactJS and TailwindCSS. The main reason I wanted to update my old portfolio website was because I felt that my css files were getting to large and wanted to learn a CSS framework like tailwind. This was a way for me to practice with TailwindCSS.

## Local Development

Clone the repository and run `npm i` to install all local dependancies. Then run 'npm run start' to set up the local host.
